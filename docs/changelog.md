# Changes

## 0.0.3

- Handle attempted charter interactions with the before-event, cancel default
  held-item use, and defer registration, the census and menu display to a safe tick.
- Accept an absent first-event flag; reject explicit held-button repeats.
- Replace the malformed panel-based UI factory with a factory control routing
  charter forms to their themed view and other forms to the vanilla view.
- Retry UserBusy form cancellations at most three times, without rerunning the
  census; never retry a menu the player deliberately closes.
- Show a player message when opening fails, rather than only logging it.
- Ten automated tests pass; Minecraft UI rendering and device input are unverified.

## 0.0.2

- Interaction-triggered, persisted 64-block loaded-villager census.
- Dimension-qualified settlement identifiers with matching legacy migration.
- Realm power scoring supports normal trade tiers, but the live rank adapter is
  still missing; show a labeled minimum estimate for villagers with unknown rank.
- Biome lookup remains unavailable with the pinned server API 2.0.0.
